####This repo is for bad usb code
#####The effect of this code is available to checked by video from my instagram: @ethan._.yyh
**Don forget to follow** 
When you insert this bad usb into others unlocked MacOs devices, it will download a picture from my host directly to the desktop, and set it as background after2 seconds. the time the process take is around 20 seconds, because I'm afraid that your target's network environment is not as good as yours. You can use your hosts and your unique pranking pictures. 
You can upload the sketch file from my repo with Arduino IDE, don forget change the domain in the file, because that will download the pictures from my web host.
####if you have some interesting ideas about how to use bad usb do prank or attack, I'm very welcome to communicate with you.
